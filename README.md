## Research Projects & Repositories

**1. [Exploratory Machine Learning for CDI](#)** *((https://github.com/Mianjian-Eng/cdi-biocarbon-ml))*
* **Description:** A proof-of-concept project utilizing Random Forest regression on a small, manually curated literature dataset. The goal was to extract basic feature importance regarding the textural properties (surface area, pore volume) of bio-waste-derived carbon electrodes and their effect on electrosorption capacity.

**2. [Foundational DFT Study: Na-Adsorption on Graphene](#)** *(https://github.com/Mianjian-Eng/dft-na-graphene-adsorption)*
* **Description:** Conducted baseline geometry optimization and SCF convergence tests for sodium ion adsorption on a pristine graphene monolayer using Quantum ESPRESSO. This self-driven project served as an introduction to first-principles simulations to better understand ion-electrode interactions at the atomic scale.

**3. Experimental Study: Bio-Waste Valorization**
* **Description:** Synthesized and evaluated hydrochar and biochar derived from agricultural wastes. The research involved conducting kinetic and isotherm studies for the removal of ions and emerging contaminants, such as dyes and pharmaceutical pollutants, from aqueous solutions.
